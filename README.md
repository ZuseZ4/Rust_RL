# Rust_ML

Small test repository to learn reinforcement learning.

neural network based code is in src/network.
actual layers are in src/network/concrete_layers, the neural network is build in src/nn.rs

#TODO
1) fix error forwarding during backprop when using multiple dense layer
2) extract AND, NOT, OR, First, XOR into own test cases
3) add MNIST testcase
4) add conv layers
5) add CIFAR10 testcase
